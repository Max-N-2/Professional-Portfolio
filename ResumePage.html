                    I was hired at CWP as an intern in March of 2020, a competitive process with a 
                    roughly 5-10% acceptance rate. From March through the whole summer

                    Duties included knocking on hundreds of doors offering painting estimates, 
                    conducting estimates by sitting down and selling
                    to potential clients by producing an estimate for their work, 
                    hiring/interviewing multiples crews of painters, meeting and discussing 
                    expectations with every all of my 28 clients, 
                    producing jobs over the summer and managing 2 painting crews,
                    managing time to fit jobs in a proper schedule, and dealing with minor issues or 
                    discrepancies with produced jobs 
                    (81 total estimates completed, and roughly 97k sold). 
                    3rd most sales in all of Michigan, 24th in the nation. Won “Top Gun”
                    award for top ten most work produced in the middle 3 weeks of July.
